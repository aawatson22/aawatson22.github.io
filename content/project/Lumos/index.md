Spectroscopy, the study of the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and matter, is a vital technique in many disciplines. This technique is limited to lab settings, and, as such, sensing is isolated and infrequent. Thus, it can only provide a brief snapshot of the monitored parameter. Wearable technology brings sensing and tracking technologies out into everyday life, creating longitudinal datasets that provide more insight into the monitored parameter. Lumos is an open-source device for wearable spectroscopy research. Lumos can facilitate on-body spectroscopy research in health monitoring, athletics, rehabilitation, and more. 

SpectraVue, an interactive web application that allows for visualization of Lumos spectral data. Utilizing a user-friendly interface, SpectraVue enables researchers to quickly generate three-dimensional plots from Lumos data stored in csv or text files, providing a comprehensive view of the spectral response of the medium under investigation. Additionally, SpectraVue offers features such as comparison of spectral data with a clinical biomarker, various data export options, and interactive plotting, further enhancing the user experience and researcher efficiency. The output graphs can be used to provide a standardization of spectral responses across a wide range of mediums, including characterization of these responses in clinical biomarkers such as glucose and alcohol. SpectraVue aims to facilitate these investigations by streamlining the data processing and visualization workflow, thereby accelerating clinical diagnostic research.
